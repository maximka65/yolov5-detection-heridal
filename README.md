# YOLOv5 Object Detection on Heridal Dataset


## Overview

This project focuses on training a YOLOv5 model using the Heridal dataset and the ultralytics/yolov5 framework. The goal is to achieve accurate object detection on the Heridal dataset and evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

## Dataset

The Heridal dataset is a curated collection of images and corresponding bounding box annotations for object detection tasks. It covers a wide range of objects across different categories, providing diverse and representative samples for training and evaluation.

## Results

The trained YOLOv5 model achieved the following metrics on the Heridal dataset:

    Precision (P): 0.33
    Recall (R): 0.221
    Mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5 (mAP50): 0.166
    Mean Average Precision from IoU 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP50-95): 0.049
    Frames per Second (FPS): 84.75

These metrics demonstrate the model's performance in terms of precision, recall, average precision, and frame rate. The results highlight the effectiveness of the YOLOv5 model in accurately detecting objects in the Heridal dataset.
